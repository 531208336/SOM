used to find sub-optimal solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem. The


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

To run the code, simply execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd som-tsp
python src/main.py assets/<instance>.tsp
#+END_SRC

The images generated will be stored in the =diagrams= folder. Using a tool like
=convert=, you can easily generate an animation like the one in this file by
running:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert -delay 10 -loop 0 *.png animation.gif
#+END_SRC
